[![experimental](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/experimental.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)
Devos3D is a 3D visualization of Devos. It allows user to get a better understanding of the spatial data.

## Fetures:
* shows 3d terrain
* loads further tiles when the user moves in a direction
* shows [osm data](https://www.openstreetmap.org) 
* shows data specific to a project
* shows current location of the user using the devices GPS
* interact with the objects added to the scene
* suporting fly-over-mode and street view mode for camera

## Resources:
### Tools/Libraries
* [three.js](https://threejs.org/)
* [simplify](https://mourner.github.io/simplify-js/)
* [suncalc](https://github.com/ypid/suncalc)
* [proj4js](http://proj4js.org/)

* [intelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
* [mamp](https://www.mamp.info)

## TODOs
### Next things to do
* getting images in a smaller size; so the browser does not have to downskale them
* prevent user going over the end of the map
* adding a button that turns the camera so that N is up
* import Project data not all at once but per tile 
* show metaData in better way
* make transparancy work correctly (change the order in which objects are rendered)
* making lighting more realisticly (shaddows, reflections)
* terrain texture (streets/woods/... as texture on terrain (would improve performance dramatically))
* [add Tests]
* [complete documentation](http://usejsdoc.org/)

### Know Bugs
* how the sun moves accross the sky is not working correctly

### Future ideas:
